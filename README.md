# Fandango-Data-Visualization

# **Fandago**

In this project I would use **Pandas** to organize the data
then **Seaborn** to explore them (report, visualization)
to finally do a data analysis is to answer the question if fandango shows ratings "artificially" higher than the average?

*   Fandango sells movie tickets online.
*  Also displays movie ratings.

We will answer with a data analysis:


*   Is there a conflict of interest for a website that sells movie tickets and displays critic ratings?

More precisely:


*   Does a website like Fandango artificially display higher ratings to sell more movie tickets?

Fandango has 2 types of rating:
stars

*   Stars

      - Ranking from 0 to 5 displayed on the HTML code of their website


*   Rating

    - the real rating that Fandago holds for this film in numerical value


We will compare these ratings with sites such as RottenTomato, Metacritic and IMDB
